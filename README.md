# Space_X_Falcon9_Landing_Prediction
## Project Overview
  Companies are making space travel more affordable for every one. Virgin galactic, Blue origin and Space x are some the companies that proveide space travel and satelite services. One of the most succesful companies at space travel is Space X, Space X rocket launch are cheaper compared to rockets from other companies. Space x falcon 9 launch is advertised on their website at a cost of $62million, while other companies that provides rockets costs about $160 million and above each. Main reason for the difference in price is Space X Falcon 9 ability to reuse its first stage. Hence if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of each launch.
In this project i'm working as a data scientist with a new company Space Y, the goal of this project is to build a model to predict if Space X Falcon 9 launches first stage will land as it can be used to determine the price of a launch.

## Data Sources
1. Data will be collected using space x rest api, this data will give details about launching, rocket used, payload, launch specifications, landing specification and landing outcome. Our goal is to use this data to determine if Space X Falcon 9 will land a first stage successfullly or not.
2. Webscrapping wikipedia page on space X historical launch data to get relevant data for Space X launches
